    <p>Experimental Algorithmics is a field that tries to experimentally measure the running time of various algorithms. While best-fit methods can of course be used, here is a simple starting rule of thumb. Start with an input size that takes at least 1 second to process. Double the input size.
    <ol>
        <li>If the run time increases by 1x (doesn't change), your algorithm may be constant time.
        <li>If the run time increases by 2X, your algorithm is linear-time.
        <li>If the run time increases by 4X, your algorithm is quadratic.
        <li>If the run time increases by 8X, your algorithm is cubic.
        <li>If the run time increases by &lt;2X, your algorithm is sub-linear (for example, logarithmic).
        <li>If the run time increases by a little more than 2X, your algorithm may have a runtime like O(n log n)
    </ol>
    Verify with a few more tests. If you don't get consistent results, there may be a random element, or you may be crossing some important threshold (for example, running out of RAM and starting to use swap memory).<br/><br/>

    <p>For the examples shown here, I picked sorting because it is a well-studied problem most programmers are taught in school.
